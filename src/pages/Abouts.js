Sadness pours

rains

Hell fire above. 

Death, hate

Wait?

Create? 

Something 

Positive they say


But I ask why

With my heart torn 

Worn 

All there is to do is morn

The death of my own soul 

Destroyed by a woman turned cold

Blood shot eyes 

Drug induced disguise 

Walking through the world 

Unseen 

Breaking the vail 

Of what it means 

What does it mean?

WHAT IS THE MEANING?

WHAT IS !?!?!?!
 
loveâ€¦.

If we are all

Not to meant to sore together above.</p>
